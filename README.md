# 4474 Design Project 

This design was created as an enhancement and reimplementation of https://www.avalanche.ca/map which is in the 
processing of being deprecated. 

A running app can be viewed at https://avalanchedesign.netlify.app/.

To run a local copy of the app you will need the following dependencies. 

```
Node v14.15.4 or greater (Tested version, the app may work with versions < but is not guaranteed)
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
